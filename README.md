# SOLID_REVOLUTION
This project involves plotting a solid of revolution using MATLAB and Python. A solid of revolution is created by rotating a curve in 2D space around an axis. In this case, we use physics-based formulas to define the shape of the curve and then visualize it in a 3D space.


# Solid of Revolution Plotter

This project involves plotting a solid of revolution using MATLAB and Python. A solid of revolution is created by rotating a curve in 2D space around an axis. In this case, we use physics-based formulas to define the shape of the curve and then visualize it in a 3D space.

## Code Overview
### MATLAB Implementation

The MATLAB code creates a mesh of values for `u` and `v` and defines functions for `x`, `y`, and `z`. It uses the `mesh` method to generate the 3D surface plot. The figure is configured with labels, a colormap, and axis limits.

### Python Implementation

The Python code is implemented in Google Colab. It follows a similar logic as the MATLAB code, defining functions and creating a 3D surface plot using the `plotly` library. It allows for interactive visualization of the solid of revolution.

## Usage

- Run the MATLAB code in your MATLAB environment.
- Open the Google Colab notebook for the Python implementation and run the code cells step by step.

## Dependencies

### MATLAB
- MATLAB environment

### Python
- Google Colab (for the provided notebook)
